## Report on Haskell in Scientific Computation

This is a report on efficiency analysis of Haskell and its lazy evaluation scheme in scientific computation. Programs for numerically solving Schrodinger equation are written in Pure C, Haskell and Python for a comparison. And it is discovered that the Haskell program with lazy evaluation scheme dramatically improves the computational efficiency.
